#### Note
Due to limitations in [ctrulib](https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib/issues/328), only ASCII characters are displayed correctly. Other characters will appear garbled, but functionality is not affected.

[Ctrulib](https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib/issues/328)の制約でアスキー文字のみ正しく表示されます。それ以外の文字エンコードの場合文字化けはしますが、機能自体に影響はありません。
